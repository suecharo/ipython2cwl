IPython2CWL is a tool for converting [IPython](https://ipython.org/) Jupyter Notebooks to
[CWL (Common Workflow Language)](https://www.commonwl.org/) Command Line Tools by simply providing typing annotation.


```python
from ipython2cwl.iotypes import CWLFilePathInput, CWLFilePathOutput
import csv
input_filename: CWLFilePathInput = 'data.csv'
with open(input_filename) as f:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(f)
    data = [line for line in csv_reader]
number_of_lines = len(data)
result_file: CWLFilePathOutput = 'number_of_lines.txt'
with open(result_file, 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(number_of_lines))
```

IPython2CWL is based on [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker), the same tool
used by [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/). Now, by writing Jupyter Notebook and publishing them, including repo2docker
configuration, the community can not only execute the notebooks remotely but also to use them as steps in scientific
workflows.
